## Usage

React => Component
React Router => Routing
Flux => Data flow

## React Router

Client-side Router
Instantaneous Page Transition
Declarative
Nested views map to nested routes -> Nesting route that help to make deep layer complex routing possible

## Flux

Unidirectional data flows
Updates flow in one direction
Easy to debug and scale
More of a pattern than a library

## Webpack

Bundler
Use npm packages on web apps
Bundles styles images and more.

## Eslint

Linter that checks for coding error issues and best practices.
It can be extended for features but default is also good enough to use.

## Why React

Fast, Composable, simple, proven.
JSX, virtual DOM

## Core Technologies

React -Components
React Routing -Routing
Flux -Data flow
Node npm -Package/Automation
Babel -Transpile
Webpack -Bundle
Eslint -Lint

# Environment Setup

Install Node
Install Vscode
Configure Prettier -> Auto format the code
Run create-react-app
Install - React Router -Routing - Flux -State Management - Bootstrap -Styling
Configure Mock API to be used for the application

# Create React App with create-react-app

====

- `npx create-react-app@3.0.1 ps-flux`
- `npm install flux@3.1.3 react-router-dom@5.0.0 bootstrap@4.3.1`

## Why Mock API

Start before the API exist
Independence
Backup plan
Ultra-fast
Test Slowness
Aids Testing
Point to real API later

## Creating Mock API

We'll be using json server.
